I like working with data, databases and SQL.

Databases had being evolved over time, from expensive relational database available from few vendor to a miriad of different engines and optimizers which are very specific for data warehouse workloads or as the traditional relational database with a pinch of the current tech as JSON, document, object storage, and most important CLOUD based engines, build to be tight couple to the features of the cloud vendor which facilitate data transfer in some way.
